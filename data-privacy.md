## Privacy policy & guiding agreement on data protection and confidentiality

As a matter of principle, we guarantee mutual confidentiality and discretion. This means that the content of health and personal data is not passed on outside the group.

We are a self-help group on the subject of complex post-traumatic stress disorder.

Our core activity is the exchange of information and experience among those affected by our problem or illness. It is about supporting each other in coping with our everyday lives. To this end, we hold regular meetings and additional events/activities as required.
We also have a chat group. We have agreed on this privately and no data is passed on to third parties.

It is not part of our core activities to collect data from our participants.

We observe the principle of data minimization, i.e. we only collect the data that we need for our core activities mentioned above. We delete data that we no longer need immediately.

E-mails are only sent as blind copies.

The group leaders in particular will ensure that under no circumstances will individual participants be associated with our illness/our problem through comments or correspondence.

For data protection reasons, we refrain from taking photos, video or audio recordings etc. during our meetings.

We inform our group members that other contact channels (such as chat groups or other email distribution lists etc.) are purely private and not related to group activities. In this way, purely private contacts can be separated from group activities.

## Consent to participate in video conferences
(e.g. on the occasion of online group meetings or online seminars)
I hereby consent to the processing of my personal data required for the above-mentioned digital data processing (video conference).

I undertake not to make any video or audio recordings of the event, either in whole or in part. I further undertake not to make any screenshots.

As a result, it is not possible to participate in a one-off video conference. In the case of recurring video conferences (e.g. regular group meetings), further participation is excluded from the next event following receipt of the revocation. The revocation is form-free and must be made to the organizer or to the person who derives the rights and obligations from the organizer to conduct the respective video conference.

This consent can be revoked in whole or in part at any time. All information and details are subject to change and do not claim to be complete.
