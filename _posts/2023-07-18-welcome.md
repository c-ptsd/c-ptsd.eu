title: Self-Help Groups Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
---

Welcome, we're glad you're here! We are a group (now an association of groups) of people who support each other on the often difficult and complex journey of healing from CPTSD. 

We have different groups: Online groups, a Berlin group, a reading group, a nervous system regulation exercise group, two reading & exercise groups. The group size is 4-9 participants each. The Berlin group meets in Moabit, all other groups take place online.

It is important to us to treat each other with respect, appreciation and consideration. We offer a safe space for everything difficult, but always with the aim of supporting us on our healing journey. We meet anonymously and everything we say remains confidential. The technical basis for our safe space is free, open-source and end-to-end encrypted software. We provide psychological safety together by actively practicing our group rules.  

Therapy experience is very helpful for participation, the group is not a substitute for therapy. Participation is only possible if you adhere to the group rules (see below) and are sufficiently stabilized.

If you're interested, send us a message to <a href="mailto:mail@kptbs.de">mail@kptbs.de</a> and we're looking forward to getting to know you.
