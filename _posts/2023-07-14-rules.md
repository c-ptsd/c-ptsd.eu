title: Group Rules
---

All participants commit to respecting our rules to foster a safe space:

1.	Common sense: all rules follow from the goal of creating a supportive environment and safe space, rules can never be complete or 100% clear.
2.	Personal responsibility: you take responsibility for yourself, your feelings, boundaries and actions. You pay attention to your needs and communicate them carefully with us.
3.	The usual rules of conversation apply: Let people finish speaking, talk to each other respectfully and mindfully.
4.	Everything that is discussed in the group is confidential and does not leave the group. Anonymity: We address each other by our first names.
5.	Disturbances take precedence: anyone who is particularly affected by what is being said interrupts the current speaker and communicate the issue. We do not talk about trauma content and avoid descriptions of any form of violence.
6.	We do not tolerate any form of intolerance, violence and aggression (insults, discrimination, shouting, etc.).
7.	Every member speaks for themselves, avoid generalizations and group-related descriptions. We do not give advice, evaluate or treat each other.
8.	Participation in the meeting under the influence of (and consumption during) legal or illegal drugs is prohibited.
9.	It is not possible for the group to take responsibility for participants in an acute crisis.  Those affected must turn to therapists, doctors, crisis hotlines, etc. It is not possible to join and participate if you are actively suicidal.
10.	All members are part of the group because they are affected by CPTSD. There is no leader. The moderation is done by experienced group members, and we strive for everyone to always take on the responsibility of moderation.
11.	Religion and politics have no place in our discussions. This includes for instance any kind of proselytism or voting recommendations.  However, this does not include talking about social dynamics and world affairs, such as societyâ€™s disregard for environmental destruction.  
12.	QAnon, conspiracy theorists, fanatics and extremists are not welcome here. We believe in scientific methods and results. Facts and opinions must be kept separate.
13.	Cameras are always on in online groups/meetings. Microphones are only on when speaking.
14.	Groups with less than 11 people are open to new participants. Bigger groups vote if they want to accept new members.
15.	Anyone who no longer wishes to be part of the group or will be absent for more than three meetings informs the group about it.
