## Challenges with CPTSD self-help groups

- **Triggers:** Group members can unintentionally set off triggers by sharing experiences, which can lead to emotional overload.

- **Group dynamics:** Conflicts between group members can have a negative impact on the group climate. Power imbalances can arise, for example if one member is dominant or unconsciously controls the group.

- **Boundary setting:** Difficulties in maintaining personal boundaries can occur, especially if participants have difficulty recognizing and enforcing them due to previous trauma.

- **Inconsistent healing:** Progress in overcoming trauma is highly individualized and non-linear, which can lead to envy or frustration among participants who feel that others are progressing faster.

- **Emotional intensity:** The nature of discussing trauma can lead to a very emotionally charged atmosphere, which can be difficult for some participants to handle.

- **Fluctuation of participants:** Changes in the composition of the group can affect stability and feelings of safety.

- **Limitations of group therapy:** Self-help groups are not a substitute for professional trauma therapy, which can lead to unrealistic expectations of the group's healing power.

- **Unclear path:** It is usually unclear which approaches are helpful and which are not, and continued trial and error is often very frustrating. Participation in the group can also be frustrating.

- **Lack of taking responsibility**: The group can only become as good for you as you manage to bring yourself and your issues into the group. This takes a lot of courage.

- **Insecurity in interpersonal relationships:** Due to attachment trauma, it is difficult for those affected to trust others and enter into secure interpersonal relationships.

- **Fear of closeness and abandonment at the same time:** Conflicts between the need for closeness and the fear of being hurt or abandoned can affect participation in the group.

- **Regulation of closeness and distance:** Finding an appropriate level of closeness and distance in the group can be particularly challenging for people with attachment trauma.

- **Self-image shifts:** Feelings of inferiority and shame can lead to people not openly communicating their own needs and opinions in the group.

- **Projection and transference:** Affected individuals may project past negative relationship experiences onto other group members or the group as a whole.

- **Need for control:** Some people with attachment trauma develop a strong need for control as a coping strategy, which can trigger conflicts in the group.

- **Dissociative episodes:** As a result of attachment trauma, people may dissociate, especially if they are triggered by the group or the subject.

- **Abruptly leaving the group:** Fear of confrontation or deep mistrust can cause members with attachment trauma to leave the group suddenly and without explanation. Breaking off contact is often triggering for the remaining group members.

- **Parallel dynamics to previous relationship experiences:** The self-organized structure of self-help groups can reflect relationship patterns from the childhood of people with attachment trauma, which can lead to repetitive dynamics.

- **Role behavior in the group:** Members with attachment trauma may tend to take on extreme roles, such as constant giving and helping or being passive and expecting help.


## Opportunities with CPTSD self-help groups

Those who are not deterred by the many challenges and are willing to face them proactively will be rewarded with the chance to take significant steps towards healing from CPTSD. According to current research, attachment trauma can practically only be healed through corrective relationship experiences. A safe place, with full understanding of the disorder, attentive and appreciative interaction, which allows people to try out new social behaviors without judgment and to have corrective experiences with others, exists virtually nowhere else. In theory, trauma therapy groups could also offer this, but unfortunately they do not yet exist.

- **Validation of complex trauma experiences:** Self-help groups for CPTSD offer a platform where the complexity and long-term effects of trauma are recognized and understood, which is not always the case in general therapeutic settings.

- **Dealing with feelings of shame and guilt:** In a trusting group atmosphere, deep-seated feelings of shame and guilt that often accompany CPTSD can be shared and gradually reduced through the understanding and acceptance of the group.

- **Promoting identity development:** People with CPTSD often struggle to build a coherent identity. The support group can be a mirror in which they can recognize and develop aspects of their true self.

- **Stabilization of emotions:** The group can teach and practice strategies for emotion regulation that are specifically tailored to the fluctuations of CPTSD.

- **Working through attachment trauma:** By working together in a safe environment, members can gain new attachment experiences and learn to build trusting relationships, which can positively influence their attachment style.

- **Recognizing triggers and dealing with dissociation:** Members can learn to recognize their individual triggers early on and develop effective strategies for coping with dissociation.

- **Resource orientation and resilience:** Self-help groups often emphasize the individual strengths and resources of each member and thus promote resilience to stress-inducing factors.

- **Promoting a routine of “safe” social interactions:** The regularity of group meetings can provide a fixed anchor in the week and help participants to bring structure to their daily lives and maintain “safe” social contacts.

- **Establishing interpersonal boundaries:** Mechanisms for setting boundaries can be learned and practiced in the group, which strengthens awareness of one's own needs and boundaries. 

- **Help in dealing with everyday challenges:** The exchange with other affected persons offers concrete tips and assistance for coping with everyday problems that are made more difficult due to CPTSD symptoms.

- **Building a deeper understanding of one's own reaction patterns:** As CPTSD is often associated with persistent and complex reaction patterns, the group can help to recognize and address these patterns.

- **Gaining positive experiences:** Through the validation and recognition of the group, participants can gain positive relational experiences, which is particularly important for CPTSD sufferers with early childhood trauma.

- **Reflection and re-evaluation of attachment behaviors:** Group work can help participants reflect on and understand their own attachment behaviors. Participants learn how early imprints influence their current relationship behavior.

- **Modeling healthy relationships:** Group members can learn through interactions with others what constitutes healthy relationships and how to build and maintain them.

- **Developing trust and safety:** Through regular group meeting and the reliability of other members, expectations of consistency and dependability are reshaped, helping participants to solidify trust in relationships.

- **Recognizing coping mechanisms:** Members can develop identification and understanding of their own defenses and coping strategies resulting from attachment trauma in the group.

- **Improvement of intersubjectivity:** The ability to understand and respond to the perspectives and feelings of others can be improved through sharing and feedback in the group.

- **Acknowledgment of needs and desires:** The group setting provides an opportunity to articulate one's own needs and feelings and acknowledge what has been suppressed by a lifetime of attachment trauma.

- **Developing self-compassion and self-care:** Through sharing in the group, individuals with attachment trauma can be encouraged to develop self-compassion and provide themselves with the care they did not receive as children.

- **Celebrating small progress:** Recognizing and celebrating small successes and steps in the group can be very important for self-esteem and continuing the healing journey.

- **Experimenting with new behaviors:** The group can be a safe experimental space where members can try out new behaviors and explore their effects.

- **Corrective experiences:** Building reliable, supportive relationships within the group can serve as a corrective emotional experience, helping individuals to strengthen and heal their ability to bond.

- **Healing through coherence:** The group environment allows for the sharing of life stories, which can help develop a coherent life story - an important step in healing from developmental trauma.

- **Developing body awareness:** Often developmental trauma is associated with alienation from one's own body. Support groups can promote techniques such as mindfulness and body-oriented practices that strengthen body awareness.

- **Building ego strength:** Participants can learn to activate and strengthen their inner resources, which increases psychological resilience.

- **Developing and practicing interpersonal skills:** The group provides a framework to learn and strengthen interpersonal skills such as trust building, conflict resolution and empathic communication.

- **Revision of internalized beliefs:** Members can question and revise dysfunctional beliefs and self-images shaped by developmental trauma in the mirror of the group.

- **Creating feelings of safety:** In the protected space of the group, participants can experience that safety is possible and positive emotional experiences can be gained that strengthen the feeling of safety in everyday life.

- **Development of emotional resilience:** - By sharing and validating emotions in the group, members can improve their emotional resilience and cope better with emotional stress.

- **Contact and sharing:** Interaction and engagement with others who have experienced similar challenges can contribute to a sense of not being alone, which is a powerful counterbalance to feelings of isolation and ostracism.

- **Encouraging self-care:** Participants can learn techniques to help take care of their own mental and physical health.
