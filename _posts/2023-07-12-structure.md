title: Meeting Structure

We start on time. We decide the specific procedure together in each group individually. We find it useful to take 5 minutes to meditate or start with a nervous system regulation practice to distance ourselves from a potential stressful day. Then we take turns for a fixed amount of time, focusing on one person. For example, sharing what happened, asking questions, discussing a topic or doing an exercise. Alternatively, we choose a topic which we would like to discuss together in the group.

## Structure of the practice groups

We start by sharing one word how everyone is here. Then the person who brought an exercise introduces it briefly. We then practise the exercise together (whether directly guided by the person or through an audio or video or text). Afterwards, we reflect on how we experienced the exercise. “Practice” can really be anything; it’s about experiencing in the moment or reflecting. The focus is our nervous system regulation, but anything related to CPTSD is possible. We will not do any trauma exposure exercises. Some exercises will be more challenging than others, and we will support each other with any challenges. Anyone is welcome to take a break at any time and not participate in an exercise. There should be an interest in trying and looking for new exercises.

## Structure of the reading practice groups

We start by sharing one word how everyone is here. Then the person who brought an exercise introduces it briefly. We then practise the exercise together (whether directly guided by the person or through an audio or video or text). Afterwards, we reflect on how we experienced the exercise. For more details, see “Structure of the exercise groups”. In this group, you should also have the desire to experiment and contribute exercise.

We then read a paragraph/half page of a trauma book and establish the connection to ourselves in conversation: what are our experiences, what does what we have read do to us, how can we apply what we have read on our healing path, etc.? We then repeat these two steps. From experience, the speaking part is significantly greater than the reading part. The aim is not to read a lot and quickly, but to learn as much as possible from it for ourselves. There is no homework, and it is not a problem to be absent or to start in the middle of a book, as it is about the content, topics and us and not about the structure of the book. Imagine an ordinary self-help group where the topics of discussion are predetermined by the book.

## Structure of the CPTSD and Racial Trauma Reading Practice Group

This group follows the same structure as the other reading practice groups. The difference is in the focus on racial trauma:

People with Complex PTSD who experience racism in their daily lives are at a unique, yet
widespread, intersection between healing from past traumatic events and dealing with
everyday occurrences of racism. It is a significant mental load and often a lonely road,
should one not have access to an informed support system and/or mental health
practitioners who are aware of these dynamics.

This support group is here to give us a safer space to read, understand, and exchange on
the impacts of racism on our mental health and our (transgenerational) trauma. We also
address the Complex PTSD itself to help dealing with symptoms and understand better how
we function. We meet bi-weekly to practise grounding techniques to regulate our nervous
system and try new exercises, which can be used on our own on a daily basis. We discuss
various techniques used to address events of everyday racism. We use practice oriented
books designed for people who are racialised and diagnosed with C-PTSD.

The advantage of this support group is that it gives us access to resources to pursue our
own healing journey, regulate ourselves more effectively and perhaps help make
interlinkages which weren’t obvious before.

This is a space for people who identified as racialized groups, have been diagnosed with
C-PTSD and who have experienced any form of racism, islamophobia and antisemitism.
