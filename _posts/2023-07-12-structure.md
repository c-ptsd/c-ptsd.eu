title: Meeting Structure

We start on time. We decide the specific procedure together in each group individually. We find it useful to take 5 minutes to meditate or start with a nervous system regulation practice to distance ourselves from a potential stressful day. Then we take turns for a fixed amount of time, focusing on one person. For example, sharing what happened, asking questions, discussing a topic or doing an exercise. Alternatively, we choose a topic which we would like to discuss together in the group.

## Structure of the practice groups

We first have a short welcome round. The person who brought an exercise introduces it briefly. We then practise the exercise together (whether directly guided by the person or through an audio or video or text). Afterwards, we reflect on how we experienced the exercise. “Practice” can really be anything; it’s about experiencing in the moment or reflecting. The focus is our nervous system regulation, but anything related to CPTSD is possible. We will not do any trauma exposure exercises. Some exercises will be more challenging than others, and we will support each other with any challenges. Anyone is welcome to take a break at any time and not participate in an exercise. There should be an interest in trying and looking for new exercises.

## Structure of the reading practice groups

We first have a short welcome round. The person who brought an exercise introduces it briefly. We then practise the exercise together (whether directly guided by the person or through an audio or video or text). Afterwards, we reflect on how we experienced the exercise. For more details, see “Structure of the exercise groups”. In this group, you should also have the desire to experiment and contribute exercise.

We then read a paragraph/half page of a trauma book and establish the connection to ourselves in conversation: what are our experiences, what does what we have read do to us, how can we apply what we have read on our healing path, etc.? We then repeat these two steps. From experience, the speaking part is significantly greater than the reading part. The aim is not to read a lot and quickly, but to learn as much as possible from it for ourselves. There is no homework, and it is not a problem to be absent or to start in the middle of a book, as it is about the content, topics and us and not about the structure of the book. Imagine an ordinary self-help group where the topics of discussion are predetermined by the book.
