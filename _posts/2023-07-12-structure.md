We start on time. We decide the specific procedure together in each group individually. We have found it useful to take 5 minutes of (movement) meditation or various regulatory exercises to start with, in order to gain some distance from the potentially stressful everyday life beforehand. Afterwards, everyone is given up to 15 minutes of attention, which they can use as they wish: For example, sharing what happened, asking questions, discussing a topic or doing an exercise. Alternatively, we choose a topic which we discuss together in the group.

## Structure of the practice groups

After a short welcome round, a person who has brought an exercise for the appointment briefly introduces the exercise and then we practise the exercise together, whether directly guided by the person or through an audio or video or text. Afterwards, we reflect on how we experienced the exercise. “Practice” can really be anything, it's about experiencing in the moment or reflecting. The main focus is on nervous system regulation, but anything related to CPTSD is possible. We will not do any exposure, but as with all other groups, in everyday life, something can “come up”, on the one hand you will not be left alone with it, that's what the group is for, and on the other hand you can take a break at any time and also not participate in an exercise. You should have a desire to experiment and be willing to research and contribute exercises. 

## Structure of the reading practice groups

After a short welcome round, a person who has brought an exercise for the appointment briefly introduces the exercise and then we practise the exercise together, whether directly guided by the person or through an audio or video or text. Afterwards, we reflect on how we experienced the exercise. For more details, see “Structure of the exercise groups”. In this group, you should also have the desire to experiment, research exercises and contribute.

We then read a paragraph/half page of a trauma book, and then establish the connection to ourselves in conversation: what are our experiences, what does what we have read do to us, how can we apply what we have read on our healing path, etc.? We then repeat these two steps. From experience, the speaking part is significantly greater than the reading part. The aim is not to read a lot and quickly, but to take as much as possible from it for ourselves. There is no homework, and it is not a problem to be absent or to start in the middle of a book, as it is about the content, topics and us and not about the structure of the book. Imagine an ordinary self-help group where the topics of discussion are predetermined by the book.
